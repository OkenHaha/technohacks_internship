# TechnoHacks Machine Learning Internship
Got the oppourtunity for a Machine Learning Internship by TechnoHacks

For my #1 Task:
## Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
For this assignment I used Random Forest algorithm for the Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of someone having diabetes.

For my #2 Task:
## Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
For this assignment I used Linear Regression for the Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of someone having a heart disease.

For my #3 Task:
## Wine Quality prediction
For this assignment I used Random Forest Classifier for the Machine Learning model to predict the quality of wine.


Along with this assignment, this conculdes my Internship on Machine Learning by TechnoHacks. I've appriciate the team and Mr. Rahul Sandip for this wonderful oppurtunity. Thank you!
